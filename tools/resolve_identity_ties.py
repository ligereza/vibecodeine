"""Resolve the identity ties the existing index refuses to decide.

WHY THIS EXISTS

``archivo_index.sqlite`` carries ``hash_state='pending'`` for 45424 of its 45536
assets and a real ``full_sha256`` for 112 (0.25%). Every consumer downstream is
compensating for that. ``project_reconstruction`` says so in its own docstring:

    a sample is not an identity: two files can agree on a sample and differ in
    full content. Therefore a shared sample hash never decides project identity
    here; it produces an explicit tie with both alternatives preserved.

There are 1348 such ties over 4104 assets. They are not missing metadata. They
are 1348 decisions the system declines to take, by design, for want of one fact.
This tool supplies the fact.

THE ESCALATION HAS TWO STAGES, NOT THREE

    stage 0   byte size          free, already indexed
    stage 1   whole file         the only paid stage

A cheap DISAGREEMENT certifies difference: two files of different size are
different files, and no further reading can change that. Past size there is no
cheaper-than-whole-file test worth running on this corpus -- a middle stage was
tried, measured, and removed. What follows is why, kept rather than deleted
silently, because the reason generalizes past this one tool.

A THIRD STAGE WAS HERE. IT WAS DELETED. THIS IS THE MEASUREMENT THAT KILLED IT.

An earlier version inserted a stage 1 between these two: hash the last 64 KiB
of each file before paying for the whole thing. Measured on the 4104 disputed
assets of this corpus:

    assets in dispute            4104
    stage 0 distinctions            0
    stage 1 DISTINCTIONS            0        <- the whole justification, and it is zero
    bytes read by stage 1   197522805  (197 MB, spent for nothing)
    bytes read by stage 2 107815334311
    read amplification avoided    1.0x

Zero distinctions for 197 MB is not a rounding error to tune away.

SPECIFIC reason: the objects in dispute here are video containers and numbered
simulation caches, and both families write near-identical trailing bytes
(container trailers and footer atoms; fixed-layout cache blocks). Even the 7
assets that genuinely differ -- consecutive frames of a fluid cache under
``LYON/3/123_flip_fluid_cache/bakefiles/`` -- have matching tails, and still
had to escalate to a full read to be told apart.

GENERAL reason, worth keeping even though the specific one would have been
enough to delete this probe: a cheap test can only accelerate the side of a
decision that has a finite witness. "These two objects differ" has a witness --
the differing byte -- and a sublinear read can land on one and stop. "These two
objects are identical" has no witness over unbounded content: no partial read
can rule out a difference still unread, so no sublinear test can ever CERTIFY
agreement, only ever REJECT it. Stage 1 was built to accelerate the agreement
side, the side with no witness, so it was doomed by construction, independent
of which 64 KiB it happened to read. Any test that reads o(n) bits can only
reject objects that are far apart; near-duplicates are provably invisible to
it, and near-duplicates are exactly what a shared sample hash selects for.

THE CORRECT SHAPE, SO THE DELETION DOES NOT READ AS GIVING UP

With m objects and up to m*m pairs to compare, the right ladder amortizes PER
OBJECT, not per pair: size, then a strong fingerprint computed and cached once
per object, then a byte comparison only where fingerprints already agree. A
per-pair cheap probe -- re-reading some fixed slice of a file for every pair it
is compared against -- is the wrong shape regardless of which bytes it reads;
the tail was just the version that got measured and killed here. This tool
does not need the per-object cache today, because at this scale the whole-file
stage already dominates the budget, but a future increase in scale should reach
for that shape before reaching for a new cheap probe.

WHAT SURVIVED THE DELETION WITHOUT ANY CODE

The deleted stage also carried a shortcut: a file no larger than its 64 KiB
window was read whole, so its tail digest WAS its full digest, and it was
certified without a further read. Deleting the stage does not lose that
capability and does not cost anything extra: such a file now simply gets a
full digest at stage 1, for exactly the same number of bytes, because the old
window already covered the whole file. Nobody should "restore" a small-file
fast path later; it was never a separate cost to begin with.

WHAT IT WRITES

Nothing into the index. The index is read-only evidence and stays that way; the
verdicts land in a sidecar keyed by ``asset_id``. A duplicate that crosses two
container roots is separated from one that does not, because only the first is
evidence about whether two commissions share a work.
