"""Recover source-to-render edges from what a .blend file declares it writes.

WHAT THIS TOOL IS FOR

A .blend file declares the directory it renders into (block code SC00, kind
"scene" in ``blendfile.read_references``). That declaration lives in the
SOURCE, so it survives any re-encode or recompression of the output -- which
is the only reason a source-to-render chain is recoverable on this corpus at
all. It is read backwards from the project, never forwards from the export.

Measured by hand before this tool existed, and reproduced or explained here:

    193  render output paths declared across 873 readable .blend files
    116  are the Blender default (/tmp) and carry no information
     10  point at another person's machine (a Windows or POSIX "Users" home)
     35  rebase cleanly but the directory no longer exists here
     27  RESOLVE to a real directory on this disk
   2189  files live inside those 27 directories

Triangulated directly against the real disk while building this tool
(read_references() on the actual files, not a transcription):

    SUERTE/TREBOL.blend       scene 'C:\\SUERTE\\1\\'                -> 100 files (flat `find -maxdepth 1 -type f`)
    3D JJJ/GORRO.blend        scene 'C:\\3D JJJ\\CUFFED\\focus\\'    -> 300 files
    3D JJJ/ANIMACION.blend    scenes '/tmp\\' AND 'C:\\3D JJJ\\letrap\\' -> 481 files (hand count said 482; see VERIFY note)
    LYON/MERECEDORA/MERECEDORA.blend  one scene, 'C:\\LYON\\MERECEDORA\\CACHE\\2\\3\\4\\New Folder\\343\\3\\' -> 156 files

Three of four direct spot checks matched the hand count exactly; ANIMACION's
"letrap" directory measured 481 files (one subfolder, "Nueva carpeta", holds 3
more, none of which reconciles the count to 482 under any simple rule this
tool tried). That is reported as a real, small, unexplained drift, not papered
over -- the corpus is a live disk and a file may have moved between the two
measurements.

The Blender default output path was confirmed byte-for-byte on this disk:
ANIMACION.blend's first scene declares the literal string '/tmp\\' -- forward
slash then backslash, Blender's own factory template, unrelated to any host
OS's path convention. A declaration equal to that string says nothing about
where the operator ever pointed a render.

THE REBASING RULE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A GUESS

'C:\\LYON\\Pajsaera\\PNG\\...' resolves to a real directory under --root
(confirmed: LYON/Pajsaera/SINBUG.blend's declared paths are real subtrees of
--root/LYON/Pajsaera/PNG on this disk). --root is a copy of that C:\\ tree, so
stripping the drive letter and rebasing under --root is a reconstruction, not
an assumption -- and it must be DECLARED DATA, not a regex buried in a
function. DRIVE_MAP below is that data: a letter, whether it maps onto
--root, and the measured reason. A second drive letter ("D") is recorded
explicitly with no root, so it resolves to "declared but unreachable" -- a
named, real drive with nothing to rebase onto here -- rather than to
"unrecognized" or silently to "not found".

A path under a Windows or POSIX user home directory is a FOREIGN MACHINE,
and that is a different verdict from "directory not found": the foreign ones
are downloaded assets or another operator's exports, never this operator's
renders, and folding them into "missing" would overcount genuinely lost
render locations.

WHAT THIS TOOL MAY AND MAY NOT CLAIM

It may certify project -> DIRECTORY. It may NOT certify project -> FILE.

1. The declared path names a LOCATION, not a file. A directory holding 482
   files is 482 candidates for which one this save of the project produced;
   that is a cardinality (``Evidence.candidate_count``), never a choice.
2. A .blend has no internal history: it is one mutable file overwritten on
   every save, so the edge this tool writes is "some state of this project
   wrote here", never "this exact state wrote here". (Blender's own .blend1
   backups are the only versions that exist at all, each exactly one save
   back -- and this tool does not read them, because a backup declares
   nothing beyond what the live file already declares.)
3. The declared directory may have been rendered into by a different, later,
   or earlier state of the project than the one on disk right now.

Consequently every Evidence row this tool writes uses predicate RENDERS_TO
under authority "blend_declaration" (already registered and already
admissible for exactly this pair in ``schema.ADMISSIBLE_PREDICATES`` -- this
module adds no predicate and no authority), with the object being the
resolved DIRECTORY and ``candidate_count`` set to the number of files found
inside it. ``schema.py`` itself already forbids this authority from orienting
a DERIVED_FROM edge; this tool relies on that existing check rather than
re-implementing it.

TRIANGULATION OF WHAT A RESOLVED DIRECTORY ACTUALLY HOLDS

A render output directory should hold images or frame sequences (.exr, .png,
.jpg, .tif -- named directly in this tool's own specification). Every resolved
directory is scanned (flat, one level -- SUERTE/1 has zero subdirectories and
exactly 100 files, matching the hand count exactly) and flagged ``suspect``
when none of its files carry an image-like extension: a directory full of
.blend files or documents is not evidence of a render, and reporting it as an
ordinary resolved edge would silently launder that distinction away.
