# xio FACES — two networks, never on the same wire

The xio system (Xiaomi Termux server + plugin stack) operates in **two mutually exclusive configurations**
that serve different purposes. Confusion between them has led to false security concerns; this doc fixes that.

**Core rule:** The MAK Linux box (codex, research, micelio) and the team hotspot (32 clients, no AP
isolation) NEVER coexist on the same network. Code-execution services are architecture-gated by design.

---

## FACE A — Home / Studio (dev)

**Setting:** A fully private LAN. Owner's machines only. Geographically: the studio.
The MAK Linux box and the Windows PC are joined by WiFi AND a direct Ethernet
cable between them -- a two-machine private link, no third party on the wire.

### Membership
| Device | Role | Network | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAK Linux box | Research + code execution (research :8890, codex :8891, hub :8900) | 192.168.50.2 | Research/codex always in this network |
| Windows PC (this repo / Cauce dev) | Repo operations, airdrop, xio PC-side tooling | 192.168.50.x | Develops, verifies, deploys to the show |
| Xiaomi phone (docked at home) | Termux server development, hotspot testing | 192.168.50.x | Runs xio plugins; reaches codex at 192.168.50.2:8891 for testing |

### Services reachable
- `research:8890` (multi-modal investigation)
- `codex:8891` (full code generator + sandbox)
- `plataforma:8900` (hub, backups, resource guard)
- `xio:5000` (phone server, with MAK on the LAN for testing)

### Trust model
- All devices are owner-controlled machines with no third parties present
- Network is fully private (owner's home LAN, wifi + direct ethernet, no venue exposure)
- codex and research run with NO token (auth deleted 2026-07-18): no hostile actors on this network, no public route reaches them

## FACE B — Live Show (field)

**Setting:** An event venue (studio, stage, outdoor, etc.). Team present, audience possible. The ONLY
network interface is the Xiaomi phone's hotspot.

### Membership
| Device | Role | Network | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Xiaomi phone | Standalone Termux server (xio:5000), on-device route/hub | 192.168.127.x (hotspot AP) | Everything runs ON the phone. NO external codex dependency. |
| Team clients (~32 devices) | FOH phones, tablets, laptops, mixing board controllers, lights | 192.168.127.x | Zero AP isolation; any client can sniff other clients' traffic. NO code execution on these. |
| Windows PC | NOT present | (disconnected) | Remains at studio; cannot reach or control the show hotspot |
| MAK Linux box | NOT present | (disconnected) | Stays home; codex/research unreachable from the venue |

### Services reachable
- `xio:5000` (phone server ONLY — no external codex/research)
- `showcontrol` plugin (OSC/Art-Net/sACN, if wired with XIO_SHOWCONTROL_TOKEN)
- `charge_control`, `connectivity_supervisor`, `hotspot_watch` (on-device only)

### Trust model
- The Xiaomi is the single point of internet and control
- 32-client hotspot with no AP isolation means team members can intercept each other's traffic
- **codex does NOT exist on this network** — all code-execution is sandboxed on MAK (Face A, offline)
- Authentication (tokens, permits) guards dangerous endpoints, but the surface is read-only by design

---

## Security consequence

This separation **intentionally avoids the risk of code-execution exposure on a multi-client show network**:

| Threat | Face A | Face B |
|---|---|---|
| LLM box compromise (stolen model, malicious script) | Mitigated: confined to owner's LAN (xio denies MAK unless explicitly trusted in the future) | Not applicable: codex never runs on Face B |
| 32-client hotspot sniffing | Not applicable: only owner's trusted machines | Acceptable: only read-only data and show-control traffic; no code generation |
| Network isolation / client broadcast | Not applicable: private home network | Expected: a show is inherently open; team coordinates via the hotspot |

**In short:** The false concern (32-client exposure to codex) cannot happen because codex is not on Face B.

## How xio knows which face it is

At startup (`run_server.sh`), the phone's current IP (or the hotspot subnet, if visible) determines context:

- **Face A indicators:** IP in range `192.168.50.x` OR the phone is connected via USB to a PC with `tcpip 5555` active.
  - xio server allows internal requests (from MAK) on the private LAN; MAK research/codex run open (no token).
  - Watchdogs + Shizuku run to support the studio dev loop.
  
- **Face B indicators:** Hotspot is ON (checked with `dumpsys wifi` or `ip addr show wlan1`), IP in range `192.168.127.x` OR `192.168.198.x`.
  - xio server disables MAK-facing endpoints (codex is unreachable).
  - Showcontrol plugin wires XIO_SHOWCONTROL_TOKEN if set (public show security).
  - Watchdogs focus on keeping the show alive (hotspot, battery, server restart).

## Network subnet history

Observed in production / logs:

| Subnet | Face | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `192.168.50.x` | A (home) | Stable, configured in router. MAK + Windows + phone (docked). |
| `192.168.127.x` | B (show) | Primary hotspot range (seen consistently). |
| `192.168.198.x` | B (show) | Secondary hotspot range (observed in one session, 2026-07-16). |
| `192.168.69.x` | Unknown | Mentioned in audit notes; no verified production log. If seen, flag to user. |

**Subnet drift is expected:** Android hotspot subnet allocation is not guaranteed. Always verify before each
show with `ip addr show wlan1` (on phone) or `dumpsys wifi` (from PC via adb).

## Why this distinction matters

**Before this doc:** agents asked "isn't 32-client exposure a vulnerability for codex?" — conflating Face B's hotspot with Face A's LLM box.

**After this doc:** it's clear that (1) codex never runs on the show hotspot, (2) the show hotspot never reaches codex, and (3) code execution happens offline in the studio, not in the field.

This lets us design each face independently:
- Face A: tight integration, optional auth (owner's machines), codex + research always available.
- Face B: read-only show control, strong perimeter guards (guarded endpoints, denylist), codex absent by architecture.
