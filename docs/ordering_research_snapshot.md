# Ordering research snapshot

This is a durable snapshot of the read-only discovery workflow that preceded
the ordering policy. It is evidence for future classification, not an active
catalogue and not an automatic promotion of any project.

## Provenance

- Run: `wmff24999`
- Source session: Claude Code session `3428381a-02ad-4101-9da5-8176cf72c147`
- Date: 2026-08-23
- Scope: SSD index and MAK evidence used to identify artist, venue and VJ work
- Method: read-only local measurements plus external discography lookup
- Agents: 14 launched, 9 completed, 5 stopped by the Claude session quota
- Result: 7 identity records and 2 measurement probes; no synthesis agent result
- Rule: preserve evidence and abstain when a name, date or role is not resolved

The raw result lived under `/tmp/claude-1000/` and is not an authority by
itself. This snapshot records the durable conclusions and their limitations so
that a future run can resume the missing probes instead of silently repeating
or promoting them.

## Identity findings

| container | interpreted identity | confidence | durable reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LYON` | Lyon La F, music artist and VJ client | confirmed | Five named work folders match released 2025 singles; the work unit is the track. |
| `HARRY` | Harry Nach, music artist and VJ client | confirmed | `TITI`, `gta` and the Chillan visualizer evidence match the artist catalogue and press. |
| `DREFGIRA` | DrefQuila tour material for *Despues del Sol*, November 2025 | confirmed | `01 CDR.mov` maps to track 01 and the tour/date evidence agrees. |
| `MARLONLOLLA` | Marlon Breeze work for Lollapalooza Chile 2026 | confirmed | `Le Trap 4`, show audio and After Effects names agree with public release/event evidence. |
| `DREFMOVISTAR` | DrefQuila at Movistar Arena, 2025-11-02 | confirmed | Venue, date and event title were independently found in public sources. |
| `FELINA` | unresolved visual/logo project, not a music identity | unknown | The local material is a 2D/3D logo and jewelry build; no artist identity was established. |
| `SCD` | SCD venue project, likely Salas SCD | probable | Local repo venue geometry and theatre-plan tools agree; the exact SCD venue remains open. |

Names such as `CIUDAD`, `CORAZON`, `golden`, `LOGO` and `LOGO ENTREGA` were not
promoted to tracks. The workflow found no reliable catalogue match and local
structure suggests visual, asset or branding work. They remain candidates for a
later project-level review.

## Measurements preserved

The SSD index contains 917 projects and 45,536 assets. Applying the declared
source-anchor rule produced:

- 774 projects with only `.blend` anchors: 85.29 GB
- 43 projects with only `.aep`, `.psd`, `.ai` or `.svg` anchors: 159.63 GB
- 25 projects with both 3D and 2D anchors: 502.18 GB
- 75 projects with no declared source anchor: 193.61 GB

The existing `projects.dimensionality` value matches the 774-project 3D class
exactly. The important correction is that most substantial finished VJ work is
in the mixed class, while many small `.blend` files are downloaded or generated
assets rather than finished works.

The collaboration probe found repeated production families around DrefQuila,
Marlon/Lolla and Harry. For RD, `TABLA_RD` is the only explicit RD design
container found: 54 assets, about 2.14 GB, 2D-only with Illustrator anchors and
no `.blend`. A literal `RDFLYER` search returned 1,499 assets inside a mixed
download container, so that hit is not evidence of an RD cartelera project.

## Incomplete work and safe continuation

The following subagents did not return because the Claude session quota ended:

- reconciliation
- histories
- `other`
- track key
- synthesis

Therefore this snapshot does **not** claim a complete SSD-to-Instagram join,
complete track mapping, or a final catalogue. The next safe action is to run
those probes independently and append their evidence here or in a dedicated
versioned dataset. No row should be promoted to authorship, publication,
consumer or postulation from this snapshot alone.

## Policy connection

`data/ordering_features.json` declares which observations may decide which
questions. `src/flujo/knowledge/feature_policy.py` enforces that declaration;
`src/flujo/knowledge/classification_queue.py` now consults it before emitting
automatic virtual-environment or content-identity proposals. A failed or
undeclared authority is a closed gate, not a reason to guess.
