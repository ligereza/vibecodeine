"""tests/test_open_episode_state.py -- attention must track work, not history.

Measured on 2026-08-21: `operational_status` built its actionable attention list
from `SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM project_episodes GROUP BY status`, which
counts every episode ever recorded. Episodes are append-only by design, so an
item like "3 episode(s) need evidence" could never be cleared by doing the work
its own next_action asked for ("attach verifiable evidence, then run the
validator again"): recording the verified execution left the old row counted and
the operator lost the difference between "there is work" and "the work was
done".

The defect was latent rather than active -- at the time all three
`needs_evidence` rows were the latest episode of their project, so the count was
still true -- which is exactly why it had to be fixed before closing them, not
after. After the repair the same ledger reported `needs_evidence` falling from
3 to 1 once two prepared consumers were actually executed and recorded.

Rule pinned here: a non-verified episode stays open only while its project has
no LATER accepted episode. History stays intact and visible in `episodes`; only
the attention list reads the open state.
