"""Attack the identity substrate: five things must stay apart.

The tests are built so that each one FAILS if two entities are collapsed:

- same content in two places must give ONE Content, ONE State, TWO Observations.
  Collapse Observation into identity and this breaks.
- same lineage with different bytes must give TWO Contents, TWO States, ONE
  Lineage. Collapse Lineage into Content and this breaks.
- zip and unzip must give the same Content. Treat a path as identity and this
  breaks.
- masking paths AND basenames AND tool-default names must change nothing.
  62.8% of the repeated basenames in the real corpus are tool defaults, so a
  test that masks only paths can pass for the wrong reason.
- two documents using one shared asset must NOT merge. This is the failure mode
  of naive content linking, and the real corpus has 48 shared library items
  spanning 9 container roots.

The XMP fixtures are real packets inside real containers -- a PNG iTXt chunk and
a JPEG APP1 segment -- because the bounded window scan that preceded this module
found a DocumentID in only 48 of 14345 PNGs, and a synthetic test over loose
bytes would not have caught that.
