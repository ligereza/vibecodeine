"""`flujo doctor` must fail closed when `git status --short` cannot run.

`doctor` runs three git calls to build its report. All three now check
`returncode == 0` and show AVISO when git fails. The regression below points
`repo_root()` at a directory with no `.git` and ensures the working-tree row
names the failed measurement rather than claiming "limpio".

This is the same class of bug fixed in `flujo github-sync --status`: an empty
stdout from a failed command must never be treated as a successful empty
measurement.

The regression test keeps the failure mode visible: a missing repository must
be named as an unmeasured working tree, never reported as clean.
