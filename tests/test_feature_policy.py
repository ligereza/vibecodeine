"""Replay the real classification errors and assert the policy refuses them.

Every test in the first group is an error that actually happened in this
repository, recorded in ``docs/ordering_chaos.md``. A registry that cannot refuse
the mistakes already made is decoration, so each one is stated as the decision
that was taken and asserted to be denied now.

The second group pins the properties that make the registry safe to extend: an
undeclared feature cannot decide anything, a chain is only as strong as its
weakest link, and a fold that declares nothing about a question abstains rather
than assuming it holds.
