"""Put a door on the classification queue, and stop asking what is not a question.

Measured before writing anything:

    classification_queue     8273 rows, ALL pending
    distinct reasons         4 -- one template per candidate kind
    writers of `status`      none; the producer is the only code that touches it

Same disease as the project queue, second location: one producer, zero
consumers, so nothing could ever be marked answered. But the shape of the
problem is different, and copying the previous door would have been wrong.

8273 is not a number of questions
---------------------------------
It is a number of ROWS. Decomposed by evidence that can be checked:

    1463  inside a virtual environment   pyvenv.cfg proven on disk
    2566  byte-identical to a repo file  sha256 match, canonical path named
    1035  in the live repository         needs a person
    3209  everywhere else                needs a person

So 4029 rows -- 48.7% -- are not questions for a human at all, and they are not
"probably not" either: each carries a check anyone can repeat. The 1463 come from
ONE directory, a Windows virtualenv copied onto the box, which the scanner walked
into because its skip list held names rather than a definition. That cause is
fixed in ``tools/build_mak_knowledge_db.py``; these rows are the backlog it left.

The question itself is malformed, and that is why it never moved
---------------------------------------------------------------
"python implementation requires purpose and consumer classification" bundles two
questions whose natural units are different, and no single decision can answer
both. The counterexample is in the data: 44 queued files are zero-byte
``__init__.py``. Byte-identical content, so identical PURPOSE -- a package marker
-- and they sit in 5 different trees, so different CONSUMERS.

    purpose / project    a function of content   -> one answer per content class
    consumer / route     a function of position  -> one answer per file

Bundled, the cheap half is held hostage by the expensive half 8273 times. Split,
the queue becomes answerable. ``QUESTION_PARTS`` states the split for each kind
instead of leaving it implicit.

What a person is actually asked
-------------------------------
For the rows that do need a person, the unit is ``(candidate_kind, directory)``,
because the coarse half of every question is a property of the directory: a
corpus folder is reference material, a tests folder is tests. Measured on the
authored rows, 5 directories cover half of them and 87 cover 80%.

This module never resolves anything by itself. The machine rules produce
PROPOSALS with their evidence; applying them is one signed act that authorises a
RULE, not 4029 separate judgements. Nothing is deleted: a resolved row keeps its
reason and its evidence, and every resolution is appended to an audit table.
