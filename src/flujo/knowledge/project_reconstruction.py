"""Reconstruct latent creative project units from the read-only SSD index.

The bounded folder scan that produced the index answers a different question
than the one Curatoria and Postulacion need. It asks "which folders contain an
editable anchor" and calls each answer a project. Measured on the real index
(``archivo_index.sqlite``, 917 project rows, 45536 assets): 758 of those rows
(82.7%) are a single library item, because a downloaded material or model ships
its own folder with one ``.blend`` inside. A funding draft built from that row
describes a purchased texture, not a work.

This module reconstructs project units over those rows. It never rewrites the
source: it reads, derives features, and records a decision with the evidence
that produced it.

Why a lexicographic cascade and not a score
-------------------------------------------
A single scalar would let a large byte count outvote the fact that a folder is a
dependency, and the magnitudes are not comparable: "82.7% of rows carry a uuid
leaf under assets/" is a structural signature, while "has video" is a media mix.
Adding them asserts an exchange rate nobody measured. The cascade instead asks
ranked yes/no questions whose predicates are individually falsifiable, and
abstains when two rules of the same rank disagree.

What the evidence can and cannot prove
--------------------------------------
``full_sha256`` exists for 112 of 45536 assets, so exact duplication is provable
for 0.25% of the index. ``sample_sha256`` exists for all of them but a sample is
not an identity: two files can agree on a sample and differ in full content.
Therefore a shared sample hash never decides project identity here; it produces
an explicit tie with both alternatives preserved.

Separation of layers, kept in the persisted record:

- RAW INPUT       a row of the index
- OBSERVATION     a path, an extension, a byte count, an mtime
- DERIVED FEATURE a computed predicate such as "leaf ends in a uuid"
- RELATION        "this folder depends on that library item"
- INTERPRETATION  "DREFGIRA is a fundable work" -- never produced here
