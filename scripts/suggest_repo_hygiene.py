suggest_repo_hygiene.py — Non-destructive suggestions for repo cleanup.

Run: py scripts/suggest_repo_hygiene.py

Two parts:
1. Doc/reference hygiene: flags files that still point at dead docs or
   dead code paths (instaloader, AGENT_GUIDE.md, etc -- the class of bug
   fixed 2026-07-20).
2. Test-quality signal: runs the suite with coverage and prints the
   worst-covered live source files, so "how many tests" stops being the
   proxy for "how tested" -- see .claude/skills/godspeed/SKILL.md point 6.

This only prints recommendations. It never deletes, moves, or edits files.
See docs/HIGIENE_REPO.md and CLAUDE.md for policy.
